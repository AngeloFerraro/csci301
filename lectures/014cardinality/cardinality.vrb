\frametitle{ Pigeonhole Principle Example }

{\bf Proposition} There are at least two people in Washington State
with the same number of hairs on their heads.

{\it Proof.}

The population of Washington is more than seven million.

Every human head has fewer than one million hairs.

By the pigeonhole principle, two Washingtonians must have the same
number of hairs on their head.
